        My main colors used are #000000(black) and #ffffff(white) and some green.

    -   #### Typography

        I used the Quicksand font for headers with a fallback of Sans Serif if for some reason Quicksand won't load
        
        I used the Lora font for all other text in the body such as paragraphs, with a fall back of Sans Serif
